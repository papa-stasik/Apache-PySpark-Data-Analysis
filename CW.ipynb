There appears to be a small correlation between price and square feet, which is to be expected as was explored in component 1. Furthermore there is also a strong correlation between square feet and the number of bedrooms in a property which makes sense as more rooms require additional living space. This also translates to the correlation between bedrooms and bathrooms, as additional bedrooms are usually accompanied by an increase in bathrooms. The square feet feature is also strongly influenced by the number of bathrooms in a property. The other less meaningful correlation is between the cats and dogs’ features. Typically a property either allows or denies pets and not specific animal species."
